# Course Repo - React Training at Tandem

December 16, 2019

## This repository

In this repository, you'll find folders for each of the subjects we'll be covering. Each folder contains the slide deck that I will present with my lecture and the pair exercise that we will be doing together. Additionally, I will push the code for any in-class demos that I do to this repo.

## Pre-flight Check

Prior to training day, it would be very helpful if all trainees could clone this repository and ensure they are able to run the apps in each pair-exercise directory. Simply follow the directions in the respective READMEs up through the heading "Starting Point"

## Pre-reading

Lectures will be much more effective and we can cover more material if you are able to look over the following pre-reading beforehand.

* [The React Lifecycle Step by Step](https://medium.com/@vmarchesin/the-react-lifecycle-step-by-step-47c0db0bfe73)
* []

## Additional Reading

If you have the time and interest to read any of these articles before training, please feel free. If not, I strongly recommend looking them over after the training is complete.

* [React documentation on Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html)
* [You Probably Don't Need Derived State](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html)
